        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Custom-built, high-performance PCs tailored to individual needs with a focus on aesthetic design, 
            reliability, and strength, delivered personally within Central Texas.

        <h2>What are you getting?</h2>
        <p>
            Each of our three options can crush modern computing tasks and are fashioned from hand-selected parts 
            to be optimized and produce the best user effect. Now, each of the computer parts themselves come with 
            their own manufacturer's warranty, so in the unlikely event that one of your parts goes down, we make 
            the process easy for you to get it switched out. Your parts each have their own warranty which winds up 
            giving you the customer a diversified warranty package that covers all your parts; and that doesn't get 
            used up after the first thing breaks or we try to charge you for repairs. Sounds like an improvement, 
            yes? No nonsense, if your part broke due to manufacturer defect they are up to the mercy of their warranty 
            agreement.

        <h2>Optimized Systems</h2>
        <p>
            Our machines are meant to tackle the coming integration of AI and anything else you can throw at it for 
            years. Take advantage of the latest Technologies like PCIe Gen 5 x4 Internal SSDs that actually use your 
            motherboard's capabilities.

        <p>
            No second guesses, each of our systems is stress-tested with a 17-point checklist designed with AI to 
            expose any vulnerabilities your system has before you get it.
