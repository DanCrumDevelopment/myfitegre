        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Custom-built, high-performance PCs tailored to individual needs with a focus on aesthetic design, 
            reliability, and strength, delivered personally within Central Texas.

        <h2>What are you getting?</h2>
        <p>
            Each of our three options can crush modern computing tasks and are fashioned from hand-selected parts 
            to be optimized and produce the best user effect. Now, each of the computer parts themselves come with 
            their own manufacturer's warranty, so in the unlikely event that one of your parts goes down, we make 
            the process easy for you to get it switched out. Your parts each have their own warranty which winds up 
            giving you the customer a diversified warranty package that covers all your parts; and that doesn't get 
            used up after the first thing breaks or we try to charge you for repairs. Sounds like an improvement, 
            yes? No nonsense, if your part broke due to manufacturer defect they are up to the mercy of their warranty 
            agreement.

        <h2>Optimized Systems</h2>
        <p>
            Our machines are meant to tackle the coming integration of AI and anything else you can throw at it for 
            years. Take advantage of the latest Technologies like PCIe Gen 5 x4 Internal SSDs that actually use your 
            motherboard's capabilities.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content-block">
        <h2>Reliability</h2>
        <p>
            No second guesses, each of our systems is stress-tested with a 17-point checklist designed with AI to 
            expose any vulnerabilities your system has before you get it.
        </p>

        <h2>Delivery</h2>
        <p>
            We deliver to Austin and San Antonio areas and everywhere in between (New Braunfels, San Marcos, and more!). 
            No extra fee required.

            My name is Dan Crum, and I graduated from Texas State University in Computer Information Systems: summa cum laude. 
            Myfitegre is a passion project and an LLC, my second business after running a carpentry business. I live in the 
            Hill Country in Canyon Lake, Texas, and have been building computers since 2015, graduating from Texas State in 2022. 
            This project is heavily influenced by AI; we're using it to achieve maximum efficiency in our operations.
