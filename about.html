        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Myfitegre Technologies LLC is committed to outfitting Texans with high-performance PCs tailored to individual needs, 
	    with our particular focus on the triad of aesthetic design, reliability, and strength. Each PC is personally delivered within Central Texas.
        </p>

        <h2>What are you getting?</h2>
        <p>
            Each of our three options can crush modern computing tasks and are fashioned from hand-selected parts 
            to be optimized and produce the best user effect. Now, each of the computer parts themselves come with 
            their own manufacturer's warranty, so in the unlikely event that one of your parts goes down, we make 
            the process easy for you to get it switched out. Since your parts are each allocated a warranty you the customer recieve a diversified warranty package that covers all your parts; and that doesn't get 
            used up after the first thing breaks. Sounds like an improvement if you've ever had a warranty experience before 
            yes? No nonsense, if your part broke due to manufacturer defect they are up to the mercy of their warranty 
            agreement.
        </p>

        <h2>Optimized Systems</h2>
        <p>
            Our machines are meant to tackle the coming integration of AI and anything else you can throw at it for 
            years. Take advantage of the latest Technologies like having your boot drive on a PCIe Gen 5 x4 NVME @ 10GBPS speeds, Ryzens 3D V-Cache, RAID 0 and 1, and more technologies that are designed to finally use your 
            motherboard's capabilities. 
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content-block">
        <h2>Reliability</h2>
        <p>
            No second guesses, each of our systems is stress-tested with a 17-point checklist designed with AI to 
            expose any vulnerabilities your system has before you get it. Your PC comes outfitted with Windows 11 
unactivated so we do not charge you for a software stack at all. If you want to activate it, it is a few clicks away, 
and if you want Linux or already own Windows, you didn't pay for software you don't need. 
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content-block">
        <h2>Delivery</h2>
        <p>
            We deliver to Austin and San Antonio areas and everywhere in between (New Braunfels, San Marcos, and more!). 
            No extra fee required.
